#
# individual_liability: Only unsatisfiable hints are disregarded. By default this flag is not set
# and the whole hint group is disregarded when one hint in it is unsatisfiable.
# 1group1gene: Try to predict a single gene that covers all hints of a given group. This is relevant for
# hint groups with gaps, e.g. when two ESTs, say 5' and 3', from the same clone align nearby.

# Explanation:
# 
# In comparative gene prediction, hints can be integrated for multiple species.
# In order to have different extrinsic config settings for different species,
# multiple [GENERAL] tables are specified. Each table is followed by a [GROUP] section,
# a single line, in which a subset of the species is listed, for which the table is valid.
# Use the same species identifiers as in the MSA and in the phylogenetic tree.
# If a species is not assigned to any of the tables, all hints for that species are
# ignored.
